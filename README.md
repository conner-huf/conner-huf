## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

### I'm Conner

ðŸ˜„ - I'm a software developer, based in Los Angeles, CA. I just finished my Computer Science degree, and I've been working on all sorts of different projects for about a year and a half now. I'm currently looking for work, but in the meantime I'm working on projects I've had ideas for, working on certifications for technologies I'm interested in, and pretty much just making as many cool things as I can.

ðŸŒ± - I mostly work with Python backends and React.js frontends. Lately, I've been developing a fullstack app for finding concerts in your area, and I'm really excited with how it's going! I've *really* enjoyed working in Unity, and I'll probably continue making side projects in Unity as a lil' side hobby. 

ðŸ”­ - I'm a big fan of video games, movies, and live music. Some of the projects I want to work on soon have to do with randomizers for two of my favorite video games (Zelda: Majora's Mask and Hollow Knight) - so keep an eye out for those! I'm also participating in GameJams and will be releasing my finished products on itch.io, so stay tuned for links to finished game projects.

âš¡ - I recently worked on a url shortener, mostly for my own use, but it was a super fun project! And now I've got some uniformity to all of my links which feels nice to look at. Unfortunately, I've restricted short URL creation for this project to avoid upgrading my plan. So you can't create your own links anymore, but I've given read access, so the links should work still!
