## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

### I'm Conner

ðŸ˜„ - I'm a software developer, based in Los Angeles, CA. I just finished my Computer Science degree, and I've been working on all sorts of different projects for about a year and a half now. I'm currently looking for work, but in the meantime I'm working on projects I've had ideas for, working on certifications for technologies I'm interested in, and pretty much just making as many cool things as I can.

ðŸŒ± - I've mostly been working in React. I've been really interested in React Native lately, and my next plan is to work on making mobile apps with it! I've also started working a lot with the .NET framework and I'm hoping to release some projects relevant to that soon. I've *really* enjoyed working in Unity, and I'll probably continue making side projects in Unity as a lil' side hobby.

ðŸ”­ - I'm a big fan of video games, movies, and live music. Some of the projects I want to work on soon have to do with randomizers for two of my favorite video games (Zelda: Majora's Mask and Hollow Knight) - so keep an eye out for those! I'm also participating in GameJams and will be releasing my finished products on itch.io, so stay tuned for links to finished game projects.

ðŸ“« - You can get ahold of me at conner.huf@gmail.com if you want to chat!
